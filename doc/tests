These statements resemble the unit tests that need to be written based on the
proposed architecture. This file will stay in place until the actual tests are
written. The QUnit library will be used for testing. The tests are grouped by
object names and will be notated as statements that we expect to be true if that
object is working correctly.

Snapshot
 * all cells of an uninitialized instance are set to the correct default value
   (CellStatus.INACTIVE)
 * getting and setting a cell status works like expected (matching position,
   matching values)
 * two snapshots are allways equal when all cells are equal
 * a Snapshot is valid if its cells are a subset of a SolutionSnapshot

History
 * an empty History does not yield any Snapshot

Application
 * a Game can be saved and restored using an arbitrary name as identification
