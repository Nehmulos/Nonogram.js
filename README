Nonogram.js is a school project that aims at demonstrating planning, testing and
development abilities by realizing a nonogram puzzle game using JavaScript.

The team determined the following conventions for this project:
 * Douglas Crockford's "Code Conventions for the JavaScript Programming
   Language" (http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html) code style is used
 * the jQuery framework (http://jquery.com) is used for simplified and unified
   access to the DOM and other common utilities
 * unit tests are based on the QUnit framework (http://docs.jquery.com/Qunit)
 * Doxygen as documentation tool http://www.doxygen.org/helpers.html
